# Oil-Research
This is a statistical analysis and presentation I prepared using SAS statistical software and a generalized linear mixed model. The data comes from a fellow graduate student's research project.

The central question: Does indirect exposure to weathered oil have a significantly greater effect on cricket mortality than no exposure to oil (control)? We ask this due to claims by oil companies that spilled oil eventually "weathers", and thus does not need to be completely cleaned up after a spill.
